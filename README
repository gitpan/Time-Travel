Time/Travel version 0.01
========================

The Time::Travel module produces a slim, quick method to slide
across the time scale over a given period (NOT a given date).

It is much simpler and shorter than the Date::Manip and Time::Piece.
It creates an object which is in fact a reference to a six-member
array. It is possible then to travel using this object and to land
(print resulting time).
